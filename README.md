# LaundryStats

LaundryStats is a project where I log data from my apartments laundry machines and analyze it using R. It was created to give me an excuse to learn how to use R and to learn more about the laundry habbits of my apartment mates.

If you'd like more information, feel free to read the [blog post on my website](http://gklassy.nfshost.com/index.php/2018/01/03/laundry-statistics-part-1/).
